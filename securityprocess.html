          <ul>
              <li>Non-disclosure of functional and technical data exchanged under the protocol to an unauthorized third party,</li>
            <li>Putting in place measures to prevent their escape in case of intrusion,</li>

            <li>Systematically validate all input data, if possible by using blank lists, to prevent, for example, their manipulation by inserting specific characters. In particular: check the format of authorization and access tokens (token_Id),</li>
            <li>Check the nonce parameter of the access token. The latter is made compulsory during the call to XConnect to avoid the replay of the requests,</li>
            <li>Check the expiration date of the access token,</li>
            <li>Check the domain name of the server returned with the name used for the server-to-server call (FS -> FD call).</li>
           </ul>

            <li>Secure the administration process using secure protocols and restrict administrative tasks to only duly authenticated and authorized administrative stations,</li>
            <li>Apply the principle of least privilege to all elements of the system ("anything that is not explicitly authorized is prohibited by default"),</li>
            <li>Systematically check the input data of the queries, whether functional or technical and from whatever source.</li>
          </ul>
